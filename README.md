1 Summary

Write a program which reformats a text file to fit in a certain number of columns (the page width). This process is called word wrapping.

Part I (50 points) Write a word-wrapping program ww that reads the contents of a file and prints it to standard output, wrapped to fit within a specified width.

For example, to reformat ‚Äúmanifesto.txt‚Äù to fit in 80 columns:

<pre>$ ./ww 80 manifesto.txt
</pre>
Part II (50 points) Extend ww by allowing the second argument to be a directory. When the second argument is a directory, ww will reformat each file in the directory and write the output to a new file with the prefix ‚Äúwrap.‚Äù.

For example, if directory ‚Äúfoo‚Äù contains ‚Äúbar‚Äù and ‚Äúbaz‚Äù, this command will create files in foo named ‚Äúwrap.bar‚Äù and ‚Äúwrap.baz‚Äù:

$ ./ww 80 foo

2 Definitions

line A sequence of characters ending with a newline (‚Äô\n‚Äô). A line may not contain a newline, except as the last character.

blank line A line containing only whitespace characters.

word A non-empty sequence of non-whitespace characters. Words are not restricted to alphabetic

characters.

A blank line contains no words. All non-blank lines contain at least one word.

paragraph A sequence of non-blank lines. A paragraph contains one or more words. 1

Implications Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters. The amount of whites- pace used is not important. Paragraphs are separated by a whitespace sequence containing at least two newlines. Whitespace in blank lines, and the number of blank lines, is not important.

3 Input

Your program will take one or two arguments: the desired page width and an optional file or directory name. The page width should be a positive integer.

If the file name is not present, ww will read from standard input and print to standard output. If the file name is a regular file, ww will read from the file and print to standard output.

If the file name is a directory, ww will open each regular file in the directory and write to a new

file created in the same directory. The name for each output file will be the name of the input file prefixed with ‚Äúwrap.‚Äù, so that a file ‚Äúbar‚Äù will become ‚Äúwrap.bar‚Äù. If a file by that name already exists, overwrite it.

Exceptions When reading a directory, ww will ignore any files whose names begin with a period (.) or the string ‚Äúwrap.‚Äù.

4 Method

We will use a greedy word-wrap algorithm: track the number of characters printed on the current line. Before printing a token, check whether it will fit on the current line. If so, print it on the current line. If not, start a new line.

Use open, read. and write to access files. Make no assumptions about the maximum lengths for a file, line, or token. (You may assume that the lengths will not exceed INT_MAX.) Do not attempt to read the entire file in a single call to read.

Use stat and the macros S_ISDIR and S_ISREG to determine whether the second argument is a file name or directory. When listing the contents of a directory, you may use stat or the d_type field to distinguish files and subdirectories.

Free all memory allocated by your program and close all files opened by your program.

5 Error conditions

If the file does not exist or cannot be opened use perror to report a message to the user and terminate with exit status EXIT_FAILURE.

If the input contains a word that is longer than the page width, print it on a single line by itself that will exceed the page width. Do not truncate or divide the word. If your program needs to exceed the page width, continue printing the input file and then finish with exit status EXIT_FAILURE.

6 Notes

If you are using a char array as a buffer, use a macro to define its length, and then test your code by changing the definition. Your code should still work even if the buffer length is 1.

In general, word boundaries will not coincide with the ends of the buffer. Make sure you can handle receiving a word split between the data returned by consecutive calls to read(). In particular, make sure you can handle a word that is too big to fit in your buffer.

You may use any of the C or Posix standard libraries available on the iLab machines. You may use code originally written by you or your partner for other assignments in this class. You may not include or copy code from other students or found on-line.

7 Examples

Here is some text that we might have in a file:

<pre>This is very good text that has been put into a file for the purposes
of being
an
example.
</pre>
That is good.

Wrapped to width 20:

<pre>This is very good
text that has been
put into a file for
the purposes of
being an example.
</pre>
That is good.

Wrapped to width 30:

<pre>This is very good text that
has been put into a file for
the purposes of being an
example.
</pre>
That is good.
